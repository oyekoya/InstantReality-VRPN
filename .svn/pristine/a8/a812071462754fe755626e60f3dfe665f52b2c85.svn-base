"""This file provides extra functionality to the Candy package.

This Python script simply sets the cursorType field of all active
windows so that the mouse pointer is changed. The default behaviour is
to set the type to "NONE" which will simply remove the cursor when it
is over the window.

The default behaviour can be changed by setting "type" to another value:

<MetadataString name="type" value="CROSSHAIR" containerField="references"/>

The type can be any of "RIGHT_ARROW", "LEFT_ARROW", "INFO", "DESTROY",
"HELP", "CYCLE", "SPRAY", "WAIT", "TEXT", "CROSSHAIR", "UP_DOWN",
"LEFT_RIGHT", "TOP_SIDE", "BOTTOM_SIDE", "LEFT_SIDE", "RIGHT_SIDE",
"TOP_LEFT_CORNER", "TOP_RIGHT_CORNER", "BOTTOM_RIGHT_CORNER",
"BOTTOM_LEFT_CORNER", "FULL_CROSSHAIR", "NONE"
