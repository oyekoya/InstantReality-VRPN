----OVERVIEW----
Our objective is to extend H3D in such a way that it allows for
interaction using a ZSpace. ZSpace.py provides an 'easy include'
to get the code base working with an X3D scene.

----FILES-----
ZSpace.py
Sets up the headtracking and stylus from the ZSpace in H3D.
Using this as a PythonScript node in your X3D file should set up
everything correctly if all files are in the correct places, 
and the ZSpaceVRPNServer has been started.

Candy_vc9.dll
The library for the Candy extensions to H3D. This dll has been modified
such that VRPNTracker includes button detection, and HVRTrackerNode has been
modified so that it extends X3DChildNode rather than  X3DNode. Candy expects
its PythonScripts to be in C:\H3D\Plugins\python, which is specified in C:\H3D\H3DAPI\index.urn.
Some pieces of code was also removed from Candy, to prevent unnecessary 
dependencies on 3rd party libraries.

vrpndll.dll
This library is needed by Candy to interface with VRPN servers, which is needed for
the VRPNTracker node in H3d.

GraspTransform.dll
This library allows for the use of GraspTransform, which is a special transform allowing
for live movement of objects depending on inputs, such as buttons. This is used in ZSpace.py to move
objects with the stylus.


----EXAMPLES----
example.x3d
This scene includes a simple red cube, which can be picked up using the main button on the stylus.

fish\Kumanomi.x3d
This is a simple scene that is an example model of a fish, which has been modified for HeadTracking.

tower\tower.x3d
Rigid-body physics example modified for headtracking.

----SOURCE-NOTES----
The solution file for most of my code is Candy\build.win\Candy.sln

----ISSUES----
* The stylus is currently calibrated so that there is an on-screen representation of it, rather than an on screen extension as in the ZSpaceExperience.

* When the screen is updated through headtracking, the on-screen stylus is moved in strange ways.

* The stylus will always move nodes in the GraspTransform, even if it isn't touching the nodes.

* GraspTransform doesn't work with RigidBodyPhysics yet.

* Since I modified Candy, these tools can't be expected to run on any computer. The modifications may be better implemented as seperate classes.
