"""This file provides extra functionality to the Candy package.

This Python-script provides an intuitive navigation scheme where the
haptic instrument is used to zoom a selected transform. Use this
script together with other scripts for moving and rotating the
transform, for example.

The following must be provided through the "references" field:
*) the transform node on which to operate.

The following must be routed:
1) To the "button" field, the button to activate zoom
2) To the "position" field, the position to use as zoom centre
3) To the "orientation" field, the (haptic pen) orientation to use
for zooming
